    <h1>Pink Pony Club</h1>
    <p>I know you wanted me to stay<br>
        But I can't ignore the crazy visions of me in LA<br>
        And I heard that there's a special place<br>
        Where boys and girls can all be queens every single day</p>

    <p>I'm having wicked dreams of leaving Tennessee<br>
        Hear Santa Monica, I swear it's calling me<br>
        Won't make my mama proud, it's gonna cause a scene<br>
        She sees her baby girl, I know she's gonna scream</p>

    <p class="parrafo">God, what have you done?<br>
        You're a pink pony girl<br>
        And you dance at the club<br>
        Oh mama, I'm just having fun<br>
        On the stage in my heels<br>
        It's where I belong down at the</p>

    <p class="parrafo">Pink Pony Club<br>
        I'm gonna keep on dancing at the<br>
        Pink Pony Club<br>
        I'm gonna keep on dancing down in<br>
        West Hollywood<br>
        I'm gonna keep on dancing at the<br>
        Pink Pony Club, Pink Pony Club</p>

    <p>I'm up and jaws are on the floor<br>
        Lovers in the bathroom and a line outside the door<br>
        Blacklights and a mirrored disco ball<br>
        Every night's another reason why I left it all</p>

    <p>Don't think I've left you all behind<br>
        Still love you and Tennessee<br>
        You're always on my mind</p>

    <p class="parrafo">Pink Pony Club<br>
        I'm gonna keep on dancing at the<br>
        Pink Pony Club<br>
        I'm gonna keep on dancing down in<br>
        West Hollywood</p>
